# Network-QoS-Measurement-Tool-
With this tool, we are able to measure all sorts of Network QoS metrics such as Throughput, Latency, Jitter, Packet Loss and also we may throughput for individual specific locations. This tool has been developed by using speedtest, ping, docker with a highly configured server. We have used this tool to collect the metrics in 5G environment during peak and off-peak hours while diving the traffic load into three parts- Low Load, Medium Load and High Load. The whole experiment has been done in a controlled environment. Dataset can be available upon request.
