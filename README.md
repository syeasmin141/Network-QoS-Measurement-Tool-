# Network-QoS-Measurement-Tool-
This tool has been developed by using python3. With this tool, we are able to measure all sorts of Network QoS metrics such as Throughput, Latency, Jitter, Packet Loss and also we may throughput for individual specific locations. This tool has been developed by using speedtest, ping, docker with a high configured server. We have used this tool to collect the metrics in 5G environment continously during peak and off-peak hours while dividing the traffic load into three parts- Low Load, Medium Load and High Load. The whole experiment has been done in a controlled environment. Dataset can be available upon request.  
We have used all types of files such as, docx, excel, audio, video, image, zip etc. to upload and download into and from the server while remain connected in a 5G network.
